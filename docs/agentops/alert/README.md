# agentops.alert Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the `agentops.alert` module. This package provides a flexible and extensible framework for building, registering, and using alerting mechanisms.

## Overview

- **Abstract Base Class:** Define consistent alerting mechanisms with `BaseAlert`.
- **Registry System:** Register and retrieve alert classes dynamically.
- **Custom Alerts:** Easily extend the framework to create custom alerting mechanisms.

## Getting Started

- All alerts should inherit from `BaseAlert` and implement the `format_alert` and `send_alert` methods.
- Register your alert class with the `AlertRegistry` using the `register` method.
- Use the registry to retrieve and instantiate alerts by name.

## Documentation Index

- [BaseAlert](./base.md): Abstract base class for all alerting mechanisms.
- [AlertRegistry](./registry.md): Registry for managing alert classes.

## Example Usage

```python
from agentops.alert import AlertRegistry

# Retrieve a registered alert class by name
AlertClass = AlertRegistry.get("custom")
alert = AlertClass()
result = alert.from_data(data)
print(result)
```

## Contributing

- Add new alert classes in the `agentops/alert/` directory.
- Document each alert in a separate markdown file in this folder.
- Update this index as new alerts and features are added.

## Future Expansion

This module is designed to grow. Planned features include:

- More built-in alerting mechanisms
- Advanced alert configuration utilities
- Integration with external monitoring systems

---

## Tests Reference

Unit tests for all core alert components are located in:

- `tests/agentops/alert/test_base.py`
- `tests/agentops/alert/test_registry.py`

These tests ensure the reliability and correctness of the alert framework. Please refer to them for usage examples and to guide your own test development.

For details on each component, see the linked documentation pages above.
